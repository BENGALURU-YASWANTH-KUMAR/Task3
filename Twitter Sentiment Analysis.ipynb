    "# 🌟 Decoding Digital Emotions: A Journey into Social Media Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the cutting edge of digital emotion decryption! Our mission is to dive deep into the ocean of social media data, extracting, analyzing, and interpreting user sentiments. We're building a powerful sentiment analysis model that classifies social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral, transforming raw text into actionable insights for brand reputation management and market research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 The Brain Behind the Magic\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We're tapping into the Sentiment140 dataset, a treasure trove of 1.6 million tweets, perfect for training our sentiment detection AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Kaggle dataset integration\n",
    "!pip install kaggle\n",
    "os.makedirs(os.path.expanduser('~/.kaggle'), exist_ok=True)\n",
    "!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json\n",
    "!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json\n",
    "!kaggle datasets download -d kazanova/sentiment140\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loading our digital gold\n",
    "column_names=['target','ids','date','flag','user','text']\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv', \n",
    "                 names=column_names, encoding='latin-1')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before unleashing our AI, we need to understand our data. We're checking for missing values and exploring the distribution of sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.isnull().sum()\n",
    "df['target'].value_counts()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Text Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw text is like a rough diamond - we need to polish it. We're using NLTK for removing stopwords and stemming, crucial steps in preparing our text for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer\n",
    "nltk.download('stopwords')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert our text into a format our model can understand. This technique helps us capture the importance of words in the context of our entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Model Building and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We're employing Logistic Regression for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks. Our model will be trained on a portion of the data and tested on the rest to ensure its real-world performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the age of social media, understanding public sentiment is like having a superpower. Our project isn't just about classification - it's about giving businesses the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📈 Monitor brand health in real-time\n",
    "- 🎯 Tailor marketing strategies based on public mood\n",
    "- 🛠 Improve products and services through direct feedback\n",
    "- 🚨 Detect and address PR crises before they escalate\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔮 Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "As we refine our model, we're not just improving accuracy - we're paving the way for more nuanced sentiment analysis. Future iterations could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 😊😐😢 Multi-class sentiment classification\n",
    "- 📊 Sentiment trend analysis over time\n",
    "- 🗺 Geospatial sentiment mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Join us on this exciting journey as we turn the cacophony of social media into a symphony of insights!"

    "### 🎨 Introducing Neutral Sentiment\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "NEUTRAL_THRESHOLD = 0.05\n",
    "df['new_target'] = df['target'].copy()\n",

    "- Memory usage: Efficiently managed large dataset\n",
    "- Null values: Ensured data integrity with no null values in stemmed_content\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nuanced Sentiment Analysis**: By introducing a neutral category, we capture the full spectrum of emotions in social media.\n",
    "2. **Efficient Text Processing**: Our optimized stemming process handles millions of tweets quickly, making real-time analysis possible.\n",
    "3. **Data Quality**: Rigorous preprocessing ensures our model works with clean, standardized text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔮 Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore advanced NLP techniques like lemmatization or word embeddings\n",
    "- Implement multi-language support for global sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Develop real-time streaming capabilities for instant sentiment tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "This refined approach to sentiment analysis and text preprocessing sets the stage for highly accurate and insightful social media sentiment analysis, providing businesses with a powerful tool for understanding public opinion in the digital age."

    "### 🎯 Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "We are focusing on creating a highly accurate sentiment analysis model. The **RandomForestClassifier** is our model of choice due to its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps Involved**:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: We load the preprocessed data, ensuring that the file exists before proceeding.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df = load_processed_data('stemmed_tweets.csv')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Training or Loading**: If a pre-trained model exists, we load it. Otherwise, we train a new model. This approach saves time and resources.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   rf_model = improved_model(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization captures the textual essence, while StandardScaler standardizes numeric features.\n",
    "   - **Model Selection**: RandomForestClassifier is used with specific parameters optimized for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   best_model = optimize_hyperparameters(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - We fine-tune our model with **RandomizedSearchCV** to ensure optimal performance, exploring a range of parameters to find the best combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Full Dataset Prediction**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
